This is folder for our capstone project code for the Introduction to AI class 144221.

Our project is Predicting house price using linear regression.

File requirements.txt includes all the library needed to run the code. You can run "pip install -q -r requirements.txt" on terminal to install the libraries.

File main.py should print out our result, please input the neccessary data to calculate the house price. You can run "python main.py" on terminal to run this file.

File data_processing.py is used during our study and research in order to analyse the data and to see if the linear regression model can handle the data or not. You can run "python data_processing.py" on terminal to run this file; you can do it if you want to check out the process; otherwise, it is not neccessary to run this file to print out our final result
